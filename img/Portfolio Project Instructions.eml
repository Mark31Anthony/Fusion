	When you see the name Fusion you think about exactly what kind =
of combination of cuisines or ethnic styles this place has to offer. It =
is the fusion of strong Asian flavors meets the rich Latin flavors. =
Going on this website you are already captivated with how the design and =
layout looks. Already just looking at the sleekness of the layout and =
how colorful the dishes look you are already enticed to try the dishes.=20=

	When you first go on the website, it has the name Fusion that =
you can click on and then beneath the name is a brief representation of =
what fusion means to me. When you click on Fusion it will then bring =
transfer you to another page which contains the 3 key components of =
options. The Menu which will show case the different options it has to =
offer: the appetizers, main dishes, and the cocktails. Just by =
brandishing the beautiful colorful dishes and drinks to the viewers you =
are drawn to want to try it out. Marketing to any establishment is very =
important.


	So with how this design and layout for this website or for any =
website is put together alone can play a big part on how viewers/ =
potential customers will take into it. I look at it as how a designer =
showcases his latest designs by marketing them through a fashion show. =
But in this case and example, those clothes then go on the website where =
viewers then have the option to purchase them. When you go on a website =
to order food or just to get an understanding what kind of food an =
establishment has to offer. You want to know if the design/layout or how =
organized it is and how the food looks. When you have too many options =
it can be very stressful for potential customers. Especially for the =
customers who have no idea what to order. This project will showcase the =
organization of the menu. Showing the different options of what to =
choose from, the appetizers with the different pictures and brief =
contents of each dish has to offer.=20

=09
	When you first get on the website, you are greeted with the name =
in a sleek large bold font highlighted to pop up from a dark black =
background. Then you are in the main area of the website which contains =
3 options to choose from. Appetizers which has a back ground of half the =
page of an asian beach side and the other half of a latin market that =
showcases colorful spices and herbs. When you click on that appetizers =
option it will then show you the the names of the appetizers along side =
a brief description of what it contains, how its cooked, and vibrant =
pictures to allure the viewer/ potential customer. You also have the =
name of the restaurant on the top left which will then allow you to get =
back to the main area with the 3 menu options to choose from. Then the =
main menu option which then allows you see the different dishes =
along-side a brief description of what it contains, how its cooked, and =
vibrant pictures. Each menu page has its own home button on the top =
left, which it is the name of the restaurant. The cock-tails menu has =
the same page layout and has descriptions on what each cock-tail =
contains. The cock-tails menu has sexy drinks in the back ground to show =
the viewer some of the options. It is a pretty simple page but it is the =
pictures of the dishes and drinks that allure and market the viewers =
into wanting to eat at Fusion.


	=46rom the websites I surveyed, I noticed one key component that =
I found similar to my website. In this case each restaurant show cased =
their selling points which are the dishes. They all either market and =
advertise the dishes and drinks. Each website offers the viewer a glance =
of what the restaurant has to offer with the main focal point of show =
casing the dishes. The alluring pictures from each website makes you =
want to order it. That is exactly what I want for my website to do. I =
want to market and show case each dish so that the viewer is enticed and =
drawn to want it.=20


	The main difference from what I want to construct with my =
website from the examples is that some of the websites are so busy with =
what is going on that as a viewer you have no idea where you want to go. =
I feel, as a viewer going on a website, you should not be overwhelmed =
with too many options. I felt that with some of the websites. You are =
not able to decide on what to do because you are given too many options. =
There are too many distractions in one page that a person cannot decide. =
With my website I would to do a more simpler route. I want to show the =
viewer the dishes and not get too distracted with too many things that =
can alter or push them away. I want to keep it minimal but also =
organized and keep the viewer allured the the options.=20


	The examples I used to help me construct my project are Tanta =
Chicago, which is a Peruvian Restaurant located in River North with =
funky art and stylish designs and cute roof top to enjoy cock-tails. A =
famous Japanese chain called Nobu which first started originally opening =
its first restaurant in Tribeca, New York City in 1994. Tzuco, which is =
located in River-North of Chicago is a sleek and modernized take of =
Mexican cuisine. Lena Brava, which is a Rick Bayless restaurant is =
another Mexican restaurant that focuses Baja-style cuisine with live =
fire style of cooking. Blue Sushi Sake Grill located in Dallas, Texas, =
is a sleek Japanese restaurant. I was captivated from their sexy modern =
take on their Japanese dishes and unique design and layout. I was drawn =
to each restaurant due to the sleek and sexy interior design along with =
their unique styles of tasteful cuisines.=20

construct my project are Tanta Chicago, which is a Peruvian Restaurant =
located in River North with funky art and stylish designs and cute roof =
top to enjoy cock-tails. A famous Japanese chain called Nobu which first =
started originally opening its first restaurant in Tribeca, New York =
City in 1994. Tzuco, which is located in River-North of Chicago is a =
sleek and modernized take of Mexican cuisine. Lena Brava, which is a =
Rick Bayless restaurant is another Mexican restaurant that focuses =
Baja-style cuisine with live fire style of cooking. Blue Sushi Sake =
Grill located in Dallas, Texas, is a sleek Japanese restaurant. I was =
captivated from their sexy modern take on their Japanese dishes and =
unique design and layout. I was drawn to each restaurant due to the =
sleek and sexy interior design along with their unique styles of =
tasteful cuisines.<span =
